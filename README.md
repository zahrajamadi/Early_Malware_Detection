# Early-Stage Malware Detection

## Project Description

# Early Stage Malware Detection

This project is dedicated to the early detection of malware using a dataset containing extracted API calls from the parent process, the primary initiator of subsequent processes [1]. To address dataset imbalances, random oversampling is applied, ensuring equitable representation of goodware and malware samples in both training and testing sets. Beyond mere detection, our goal is to pinpoint malicious activities as primary indicators of malware existence. To achieve this, we tokenize sequences of API calls into 2-gram and 3-gram strings, creating novel features for analysis. These features serves as the important indicators of the early presence of malware.
